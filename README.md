# Personal Website

A portfolio demonstrating various skills in HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

The portfolio itself was built using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Media Queries and JavaScript to add responsiveness to the website for mobile viewing.

Kudos to [Chris Ferdinandi](https://github.com/cferdinandi) for a lightweight, easy to use [smooth scrolling script](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll) which can be used in place of CSS smooth-scroll which, as of the time of writing, is not fully supported by all browsers.
